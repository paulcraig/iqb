    "Python is a computer programming language that has become ubiquitous in scientific programming.  Our lessons will run python *interactively* through a python interpreter inside a Jupyter notebook.  The [setup](setup.ipynb) page should have provided information on how to install and start a Jupyter notebook.  Everything included in a code block is something you could type into your python interpreter and evaluate.\n",

    "### Setting up your Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "If you are reading this page, then you have succeeded in gaining access to Jupyter notebooks. Now, we will use the notebook to execute Python code. Jupyter notebooks are divided into cells. You run a Jupyter notebook one cell at a time. To execute a cell, click inside the cell and press `shift+enter`.\n",

    "Jupyter notebooks allow us to also use something called **markdown** in selected cells. We can use markdown to write descriptions about our notebooks for others to read. It's a good practice to have your first cell be markdown to explain the purpose of the notebook. Let's do that in our first cell. Click inside the first cell, then on the top of the screen select Markdown from the dropdown menu that says *Code*. \n",

    "If you use the jupyter notebook for your python interpreter, the notebook only executes the current code block.  This can have several unintended consequences. If you change a value and then go back and run an earlier code block, it will use the new value, not the first defined value, which may give you incorrect analysis.  Similarly, if you open your jupyter notebook later, and try to run a code block in the middle, it may tell you that your variables are undefined, even though you can clearly see them defined in earlier code blocks.  But if you didn't re-run those code blocks, then python doesn't know they exist.  "
